##88. Merge Sorted Array

#You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

#Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

#The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.


#Example 1:

#Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
#Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
#Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
#The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
